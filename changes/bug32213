  o Minor bugfixes (dirauth module):
    - When the dirauth module is disabled, reject attempts to set the
      AuthoritativeDir option, rather than ignoring the value of the
      option. Fixes bug 32213; bugfix on 0.3.4.1-alpha.
    - Split the dirauth config code into a separate file in the dirauth
      module. Disable this code when the dirauth module is disabled.
      Closes ticket 32213.
  o Minor features (relay module):
    - When the relay module is disabled, reject attempts to set the
      ORPort, DirPort, DirCache, BridgeRelay, ExtORPort, or
      ServerTransport* options, rather than ignoring the values of these
      options. Closes ticket 32213.
    - Split the relay and server pluggable transport config code into
      separate files in the relay module. Disable this code when the relay
      module is disabled. Closes ticket 32213.
  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - Simplify some relay and dirauth config code. Closes ticket 32213.
  o Testing:
    - Improve test coverage for relay and dirauth config code, focusing on
      option validation and normalization. Closes ticket 32213.
